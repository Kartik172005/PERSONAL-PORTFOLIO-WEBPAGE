# Personal Portfolio Website – Kartik Gawade

##  Project Overview

This project is a **responsive personal portfolio website** developed using **HTML5 and CSS3**. The website is designed to showcase my profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a clean, modern, and professional way. It acts as an online resume and a digital portfolio that represents my journey as a **beginner frontend web developer**.

The portfolio is built as a **single-page application** with smooth scrolling navigation between different sections such as Home, About, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The main focus of this project is simplicity, responsiveness, and clean UI design using core frontend technologies without any external frameworks.
